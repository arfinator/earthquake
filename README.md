# How to: Use the Oozie Shell and Java Actions

Blog Post: http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/03/how-to-use-oozie-shell-and-java-actions



## Building the Java Code

----
The Java code used in the Java action is located in the Earthquake-J folder and is a standard maven project.

1. cd to Earthquake-J
1. Run `mvn clean package` to generate `target/Earthquake-J-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`


## Preparing the Workflow

----
The Oozie Workflow is located in the Earthquake-WF folder.

1. After building it, copy the Earthquake-J-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file to the `Earthquake-WF/lib/` folder (this allows the WF to find the JAR)
1. Upload the Earthquake-WF folder somewhere in HDFS (e.g. `/user/${user.name}/Earthquake-WF`)
1. Open job.properties and adjust the various properties as necessary; these four in particular:
  - `oozie.wf.application.path` should point to where you uploaded Earthquake-WF
  - `dataInputDir` should point to where you want the data downloaded to
  - `outputDir` should point to where you want the processed output data
  - `earthquakeMinThreshold` the minimum earthquake magnitude to use


## Running the Workflow

----
You can now create a Coordinator job to run the workflow every hour.  If you'd like to test it out by running the Workflow directly
you can follow these instructions (from the Earthquake folder):

1. Run `hadoop fs -put Earthquake-WF Earthquake-WF`
1. Run `oozie job -config Earthquake-WF/job.properties -run -oozie http://some.hostname:11000/oozie`
